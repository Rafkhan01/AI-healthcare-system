# AI-Based Symptom Severity Analyzer & Medicine Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to help users identify potential health issues, assess the urgency of their condition, and understand medication options.

## 🚀 Features
- [cite_start]**Disease Prediction:** Analyzes multiple symptoms to predict the most likely underlying condition[cite: 26].
- [cite_start]**Severity Scoring:** Calculates a risk score (Low to Critical) based on symptom intensity and medical urgency[cite: 27, 46].
- [cite_start]**Medicine Recommendations:** Suggests appropriate medications and provides side-effect awareness using a dataset of 250k+ medicines[cite: 29, 62].
- [cite_start]**Safety Precautions:** Offers immediate steps and precautions to take for the predicted disease[cite: 28].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 50]
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Handling), Scikit-learn (ML Modeling)
- [cite_start]**Deployment:** Streamlit (Web Interface) [cite: 38, 50]

## 📊 Datasets
- [cite_start]Disease-Symptom dataset for classification[cite: 53].
- [cite_start]Symptom severity weights for risk assessment.
- [cite_start]Comprehensive Medicine Usage & Side Effects dataset.
